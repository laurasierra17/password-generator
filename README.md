# Password Generator

![GIF](./assets/images/demo.gif)

## Description
This application generates a password for a user given the following preferences selected by the user:
1. Length
2. Inclusion of lowercase characters (yes/no)
3. Inclusion of uppercase characters (yes/no)
4. Inclusion of special characters, such as "/!@#$%^&*()" (yes/no)
5. Inclusion of numeric characters (yes/no)

When the user first opens the application, a "Generate Password" button is rendered. Upon being clicked, the user is prompted to state their desired length between 8 and 128 characters. Subsequently, they are asked to select at least ONE character type to select from (lowercase characters, uppercase characters, special characters, and digits). Upon completion, their newly generated password appears on the screen, available to be copied.

## Future Implementations
Some implementations I would like to add are:
1. Allowing instant copy of the generated password once the user clicks it.
2. Remove the usage of prompts, alerts, and confirms to ask for user input and give feedback.
